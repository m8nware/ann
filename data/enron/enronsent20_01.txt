Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% 
year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.  We have been able to keep ENA's direct 
group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate 
allocation flat year to year as well.  Do you have a view on how we might be 
able to achieve this goal?

Regards
Delainey

Don't worry about it ... sorry for putting you back on speaker.  I just 
wanted Sue to hear (she enjoys utility bashing so much).  Thanks for the 
comment on the hearing.  In some respects I don't think the first panel could 
have gone much better;  everyone thanked FERC for intervening (though for 
different reasons).  The other staff reports are also looking good.  Scott 
Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is.

I apologize if I offended anyone.  Please let them know that I was simply 
quoting the CEO of a large, regulated utility in  California.  Thanks for 
attributing the quote to me.  You did a great job at the hearing----it went 
decidely downhill after you left.

Best,
Jeff

Does she have any interest in meeting one-on-one or is she just looking for a 
public hanging?  I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in 
front of people they will modulate their approach.

Given the short notice, we will politely decline to participate at the 
hearing on Monday, but will let the good Senator know that, in general, we 
intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a 
solution that works for everybody.  Amen.

See below.  Can we get some help on the IBM issues?

Steve:

At this point, our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they 
can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems.  There are still four 
important issues, however:

IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains.  This means 
that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron 
organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain.
No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use 
their proprietary message delivery tool, WebSphere, and will use WebLogic 
instead.  WebLogic is required by BackWeb, although it is designed by a 
separate company.
HR, intended to be a key user of this tool, will not use BackWeb because 
survey responses cannot be made anonymous.  HR has already purchased a tool 
called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys.
Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same 
domain, nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent 
by the message administrator.

Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and 
disappear within a set period of time, meaning users cannot retrieve them and 
read them later (as they can with e-mail).  This means that I could be away 
from the office for several days and miss a message entirely, because it 
would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned.

The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative, but 
they lack commercial sponsorship.  They are hoping Corp will foot the bill 
for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing 
it company-wide.

Please let us know if you have additional questions.

Do we have a sense for how many we can reach, how many we can't and where 
they are?  Are whole offices (eg Tokyo) unreachable or is it only those who 
have home offices?

Mark and Steve- 

Erin Rice and I would like to meet with you to discuss the issues concerning 
BackWeb before we proceed.  As you can see from the Design Document, they are 
pretty significant.

Thanks,
 Courtney
