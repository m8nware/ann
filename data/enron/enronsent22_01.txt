Hello Janice:

 I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It 
sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always 
difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and 
ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we 
can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege 
to have been raised in such loving homes.

 Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an 
excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 
inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters 
ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great 
deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger 
"Rees" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange 
tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit 
Houston.

 I hope you have a great summer.

Thank you for your recent request for Mr. Lay to speak at your conference.  
Unfortunately, do to Mr. Lay's schedule he will not be able to participate.

Thank you again,

Tori L. Wells
Executive Secretary

Hi -

Just to let you know that it looks like one day will work.  I want to check 
with Mr. Lay before confirming.

Thanks.

 Dear Ken,

 As you know, our next meeting is on Wednesday, July 12 from
3:00-5:30 p.m.  In the next week or so, we'll be sending around a discussion
paper which we hope crystallizes the issues, and we will try to talk to as
many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it.

 Meanwhile, Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to
brainstorm on the ideas we've generated and also to give us a sense of some
of the issues as he sees them.  There are three possible dates for the
meeting, which I suggest be in two parts -- first, a meeting among the panel
only from 5:00-6:30 p.m., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from
6:30-8:30 p.m.  Here are the dates:

 Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for
you:

  ___________ Thursday, September 14  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Monday, September 25  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Wednesday, September 27 5:00-8:30 pm

 Many thanks,
 Jeff Garten

Good morning, Kitty -

Ken Lay would like to have the Armada M306 series - "the first ultra portable 
notebook designed for the enterprise".  Ken said to go ahead and equip it 
with what you think it should have.

Please let me know when he can expect to receive it.  Thanks, Kitty.

Rosalee

  Here is the link to the latest commercial laptops on the market,  I will
follow up with the consumer models.

The M300 series are the lightest and the E500's are the all in one but much
heavier.

where he is a speaker, on June 14.

RE:??? June 14 Reception 

Recently Charles Miller and David Dewhurst sent you an invitation 
to a reception which they are hosting on Wed. 6/14 at 5:00 PM to be 
held at the Houston Petroleum Club. 

I hope that you will be able to attend that event. 

Under the leadership of Governor Bush and others we have made real progress 
in Education in Texas over the past decade.? Now it is time to take 
the next steps and achieve even greater progress in our public education 
system. 

The Texas Education Reform Caucus is made up of business leaders, educators, 
and elected officials dedicated to finding common sense approaches to 
improving 
education in Texas. 

I would appreciate the opportunity to visit with you on the 14th. 

Kent Grusendorf 
State Representative District 94

This is o.k. for Ken Lay, but we are changing to a more uniform address, so 
would likely be better to use kenneth.lay@enron.com.

This is a "test email send" of the WPO Forum Group from Richard Everett.  By
return email, please verify that you received this message and let us know if
there is another email address that you prefer us to use.

Thank you.

Hi Mr. Katsof -

I believe someone called about this today, but Mr. Lay asked me to let you 
know that these dates don't work for him, either.  Sorry.
