Vince, 

We are still trying to work the PSE swap transaction, now that the forex desk 
has been able to find a fix for CPI in the market. 

Further to my voicemail, our colleagues in credit are calculating the reserve 
on the PSE swap.  They are currently using 9.5% fixed based on the 1 year 
implied volatility.  Volatility of USD/DM has been in the range of between 7% 
and 11%.  Can one of your research staff justify a suitable 20 year 
volalatility number for USD/Euro.  Ideally, we would like a fast turnaround.  

In addition, is there someone who could consider the correlation between US 
CPI and the $/euro exchange rate.  The credit guys are currently assuming 
that there is no correlation and may consequently be double dipping the 
credit reserve on this basis too.  

Grateful for any help or suggestions you could provide. 

Sid 

Vincent,

I met you at the Risk conference last week in Houston. I enjoyed your
presentations very much.
I was wondering if you could give me some references regarding the
calculation of correlation coefficients from a GARCH model.

Thank you.
