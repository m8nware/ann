It's a two way street, of course.  Have they expressed any interest in
negotiating?  There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation, but nothing
particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show.
Particularly in the absence of any entreaty from them.

Where is the "simple" explanation of the transportation piece?

As I have told RNR, I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is
not in conformity with the contract, sinceit is in the alternative, and that
our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators (since Duke
clearly cannot change it's ineffective IP at this stage, having already seen
ours).  Accordingly, the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP
(the only one and therefore the one they have to choose) is or is not an
economic hardship under the contract.  What say ye?

Richard,

How does this look?  If I can get a few minutes with Mark H. today, I'm going 
to propose that I speak to Stan Klimberg about getting this signed before 
Thursday's meeting with LIPA.  Thanks for your help this morning.

Steve

In the three years I have been here, I am unaware of an ENA/ECT bad faith 
claim against any insurance company. Anyone else? If so, please contact 
Michelle.

Justin, I have no knowledge of any bad faith actins Enron has pending inTexas 
but I will call Richard Sanders who manages domestic litgation here.  I've 
read the materials you sent and agree we need to address these allegations 
appropriately.  

Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in 
Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed??  We sued Houston Casualty 
last year but I don't recall making any bad faith claims.  It settled anyway, 
a long time ago.
mb

Michelle,
Did you get my fax on Friday? I guess the questions on which I should like
your steer are: (a) Do you have a particular sensitivity about the reference
to bad faith proceedings made by United India? (b) Is it right that Enron
has 3 sets of bad faith proceedings in Texas? (c) Are you happy with the
draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you?

Please give me a call if you would like to discuss.

Justin

Not when I was there, but I wasn't there the whole time.

Michelle and Ken,

were you able to discuss the "bad faith" proceedings issue yesterday? If
you
got the chance today, I should be really grateful if one of you could give
me a call to discuss this issue; I think we should set out DPC's position
clearly on this in correspondence without too much delay.

Justin

Hi Rich,

Have you heard if the Kinga has had little Brian II yet?  Also, remind me of
Patterson's email, so I can harass him directly.

Hope your pre Chanukah planning is going well.

Here are the revised dates for the response/reply/and hearing dates for
Enron's motion to compel.  As you may recall, they say they want a
deposition on the parties'  intention.  We should be expecting a deposition
notice soon if they are going to follow through on their threat.

I passed along to Liz Austin your request regarding pleadings A&K has filed
setting forth the Trustee's position in connection with the
enforcement/nonenforcement of the power contracts and what remedies the
Trustee is seeking.  As you see below, she is pulling those together.

Call to discuss the response to the Trustee's settlement offer.

Thanks.
Hi--Talked to Craig and the Court today.  The motion to compel is now
scheduled for Dec. 12 at 2p.m.  The trustee's oppositon papers are now due
Nov 27 and Enron reply is due Dec 1.  I have my paralegal gathering the
pleadings Enron requested.  That is all for now.--Liz

Dear Mr. Sanders - 
?
While I left a you a phone message with some information about  our project, 
I thought I could give you some additional details by e-mail as  well...
?
We are still very interested in having Enron support our  eCommerce Dispute 
Management Protocol.? We have had enthusiastic responses  from companies such 
as AT&T, Duke Energy, Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler,  and I would be 
pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal  point for our 
educational efforts.? The real purpose of my call, however,  is related to 
the services we will provide to support the aspirational  statements of the 
Protocol.

I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American  
Arbitration Association's dispute management systems and services for 
eCommerce  B2B transactions.? At this time we are putting together small 
working  groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial 
service  offerings.

Initially our design group, along with perhaps one of our  technology 
consultants, would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half  a 
day.? Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from  finance, 
legal, and operations so that we get good cross-functional feedback  about 
our services.? Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief  
description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for  
discussion at the meeting.

The real focus of the meeting will be on how  we should build these services 
to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B  marketplaces.? We are very 
concerned with providing services that are  relevant to that environment.

We would like to meet between November 14  and?December 1?since construction 
of our services is already  underway.? Please let me know what is possible, 
and feel free to give me a  call if you have any questions (978-376-9004).
?
Thanks.

Hello Energyphiles:

OK, perhaps it was inevitable.  But it is now official.  A team of San
Diego's best anti-trust and class action attorneys has been assembled to
take on the electric generators and marketers in California state court in
an effort to return the electricity overcharges that have battered San
Diego and the rest of California this year.    A press conference will be
held to discuss the consumer class action lawsuit to be filed today.

WHEN:   11am - noon

WHERE:    550 West C  St.  (b/t Columbia & India)
  Suite 1810
  Law Offices of Levine, Steinberg, Miller & Huver
  619-231-9449

WHAT:  Copies of the filed complaint will be made available at that
time.  UCAN's   executive director and the attorney team will be
available
to answer questions   about the complaint.   We are hopeful that
we can
post the complaint to the   UCAN web site later today.
