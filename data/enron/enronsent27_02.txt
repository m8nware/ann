John,

Hello from South America.  I just got your email and I certainly concur with 
Jeff making the call.  He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva. This 
was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding 
performance.  I don't know how much it will help however.  Richard Harper and 
Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you've already gone 
through it with them.  I am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old 
project.  When you discussed it, i was trying to think back to our remedies 
and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult.

I don't know if there is anything I can do but I'm always willing to help.

Good luck,
Mike
