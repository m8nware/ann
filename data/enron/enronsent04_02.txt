not sure, but i assume that the bluegrass songbook is mine.  is it for 
guitar?

I'll need to ponder.  I'll try to get back to you pronto.

FYI.  We have this report?

Hi David:  Thought that you might be interested.

Best,

Well, he launched today.  Have you seen the materials from the press 
conference that he launched today?  I think this is actually a good 
thing--makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by 
comparison, makes our support in the process more important, and sets Harvey 
up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California's broken 
system---a potential spoiler.

Hi.  Well, wouldn't you know it.  I'm not driving tonite, but I bet that we 
could hitch a ride back with Anil.  I'm not sure, but I think that he's got 
class tonite, too.  I'll search him out before class or after that break and 
see if I can set it up.
