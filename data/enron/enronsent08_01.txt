Glad to hear all is well. I meant to comment that I thought the people profiled in the 
article should pull their heads out of their self important asses. It isn't about finding the
 meaning of life at work. It is all about the $$$. Work hard. Make $$$. Retire young. Things 
with me are great. Moving back to Calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than I th
ought I would be going back but when opportunity knocks you gotta go. Take care. 

I don't hear from you in months and then you level me with such a thought
provoking, soul searching article.  Thanks for thinking of me to send it to.
  I really enjoyed reading it.  We certainly fit into certain parts of the
article.  There are a few life theories like that which working through.
Its all interesting stuff.

How are things going with you?  Are you enjoying Houston?

London has been great.  Brokering over here has been pretty rewarding.
Traders over here seem to have a lot more respect for other humans.
Catriona is well and has landed herself a pretty cool job in PR.

Keep in touch,

Mike

For me it isn't about fulfillment or finding my life's purpose in my work. It's all about the $$$. Work hard and retire early.

Cheers

P.S. I am moving back to Calgary in about a month. Enron continues to feel free to move me around at will. I am actually really looking forward to it.

let's discuss next time we have amstel lights together.

I was thinking of converting it to a hover vehicle. I might just sell the car and get you to drive me around all winter. 

How about skidoo skis for the front and tracks for the back..

Lexus IS 300. Not sure if I am going to buy 17" or 16" wheels for the
winter. Jackass.
