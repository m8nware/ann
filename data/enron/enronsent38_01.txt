Marianne:
The following are my comments:

1. In Section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line.

2. In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert "a" before 
the word "change" and after the word "in".

3. In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.  Also, add a semicolon 
at the end of clause (i).

4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is 
still an open issue.

5. In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in 
the beginning of the Section.

6. Capitalize the word "facility" in the definition of Average Annual Load 
Factor.

7. Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.

8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?

9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.  Also, in the 7th line 
of the reps add the word "into" after the word "entered" and before the word 
"this".

10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.  I 
will also add granting/perfection language.

11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm 
not sure exists.  In clause (e), delete the "s": from the word consolidation.

12. Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1.

13. In UCC/Disclaimer of warranties, add a clause (c).

I would add setoff language.

Carol:

I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our 
long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short 
form.  Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for 
your review.  

Please note the following as you review:

1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing 
billing services -- all of our midmarket  forms anticipate that we will act 
as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related 
to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and 
pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.
2.  I did not include a "Setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the 
vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another 
agreement in place with these customers.  If you feel strongly about our 
including a setoff provision, we will do so.
3.  The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- 
the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather 
harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).  Taking into 
consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, 
including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or 
practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see 
the GTCs).  Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in 
the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the 
interest of "saving space" than anything else...

Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with 
our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.  If you are 
comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.

Thanks again for your help with this project,

Marianne

P.S.  Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your 
response -- they will be taking this project during my "hiatus"  --  I am 
moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through 
approximately 7/16.  I will start up again in mid-July...

John:
 I have faxed to you the form of Bond, our proposed Bond provisions and the 
EEI Master.  I am waiting on the confirms and will send them to you shortly 
by fax or e-mail.

Our letter of credit person would be more comfortable if we deleted all of 
the language that makes the LC transferable.  Are you okay with that?  If so, 
are we ready to execute?

Carol:  I understand that we are still reviewing the attachment that lists
the open transactions.  How are you making out on the revised version of
the LOC?

Marianne:
In addition to my other comments on the Mid Market Power Form, I think you 
should add a forward contract rep.

As I mentioned in my e-mail, John Lepore at Select Energy (Settlements Group) 
is trying to reconcile our list with his list.  He needs more info about 
these trades (i.e., price info) and would like to talk with you about it.  
His number is 860-665-2368 and e-mail address is leporjj@selectenergy.com.  
Once we agree on the list, we can sign the EEI Master.

Do you want 6/1/01 and forward or do you want to include all of May since 
they have not been settled?  Just let me know and I can send you a new 
attachment.

Does Attachment A to the Select EEI Master need to be updated or is the 
version that you sent to me the current version?

Carol - I think Valerie Mooney (our credit person) and Ed Sacks are still
discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format.  I spoke to Bob Bruce
this morning - we're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA,
and there is a minor credit/billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the
timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed
as well.  As far as the EEI goes, the only remaining issue that I'm aware
of (aside from finalizing the LOC) is whether we've finished coordinating
the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions.  Sounds like we
may actually get these documents executed early next week.

     Carol - Our credit person doesn't understand why the transferability
language needs to be eliminated.  It simply refers to the same ICC
publication for the transfer process that governs the letter of credit
generally.  Is there some specific concern that we can address?

Russell:
Your comments to the transfer agreement were fine.  With respect to the 
Guaranty, I will delete the Schedule.  Our system did not show any other 
chnages.  Were there any?
Carol

Yes.
