  The eThink Team
We recently asked you to create an eSpeak "wish list" for us.  The response 
was tremendous and, in some cases, very creative.  Your fellow employees 
asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush.  In all, we received 
requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event.  We thought 
you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting, so we've 
provided a sampling of the suggestions below.  Here are the top ten most 
requested eSpeakers.

10.  Jack Welch, CEO, General Motors 
9.  Scott McNeally, CEO, Sun Microsystems 
8.  Satisfied Enron Customers
7.  Stephen Covey, author, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
6.  Oprah Winfrey, talkshow host
5.  General Colin Powell, former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S.A. 
4.  Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Federal Reserve, U.S.A.
3.  Former U.S. President George Bush 
2.  Bill Gates, CEO, Microsoft 
1.  Texas Governor George W. Bush

While we can't make any promises, we will do our best to bring in at least 
some of these special guests.  If you have any contacts who could help us get 
in touch with these guest speakers, please let us know at ethink@enron.com.  
Everybody needs a little help now and then, even eSpeak.

There were plenty of internal speakers requested, as well.  Those requests 
should be somewhat easier to meet, although scheduling time with some of our 
colleagues can be quite a task!

Thank you all for your participation.

Dale,

Confirmed.

Vince

Vince:

7am at Hyatt Regency Downtown would be perfect. I will see you in the lobby
at 7am.

Best regards, Dale
Dale,

Friday is a bad day (Performance Review Committee all day).
What about 7:00 at the office or breakfast meeting at 7:00? We can meet
at Hyatt Regency Downtown (Smith Street).

Vince

Vince:

Can we get together Friday morning July 7 at 800 am at your office?  That
would be particularly convenient for me.  I will have to leave downtown at
about 945 to catch a plane.  That will ensure that I wont take up too much
of your time!!  Thanks for your efforts here, and thanks for being patient
with me.

FYI

Vince
sold! I'll initiate the call.

Ed,

Thursday works for  me. What about 10:30  my time?

Vince

Please respond to <ekrapels@esaibos.com>

how about Thursday, July 6?

Ed,

A correction. I shall spend an entire day at PRC (performance review)
on Friday, July 7. Can we do on another day

Vince

Please respond to <ekrapels@esaibos.com>

I'll still be here in Boston so we'd do it over the phone. OK?

Ed,

Will you be in Houston on that day or we shall do it over the phone?

Vince

Please respond to <ekrapels@esaibos.com>

Vince,

How about a pre-meeting web site cruise on Friday, July 7 at 11AM EDT?

Ed

Ed,

July 12, 2:30 it is. I would like the pre-meeting site cruise.
How can we arrange it?

Vince

Please respond to <ekrapels@esaibos.com>

Vince,

We're all set for 2:30 on July 12. How about a pre-meeting web site cruise
on Friday, July 7 at 11AM EDT?

Ed

Ed,

Wednesday, July 12, 2:300 will work for me.

I shall be glad to review your website --
www.weathereffects.com. I shall invite some
people who work on electricity in
my group to join me.

Vince

Please respond to <ekrapels@esaibos.com>

Vince,

Good to hear from you and I'm glad you're available. How is Wednesday at
2:30?

I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality. I was unable to
say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because
of deadline pressures. How is the site doing? I am intrigued by the
competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman,
Morgan, BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours. Talk
about a shotgun marriage!

If we have time next week, I could step you through our website --
www.weathereffects.com. I'm very proud of what we've done. I can't give out
a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the
phone using my password. It's a very ambitious site -- with state-of-the-art
WSI weather (seasonal, 6-10, and day to day) driving a good load model for
PJM and NEPOOL. ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts, capacity
judgments, and "herding" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same
time periods. After one month's full-bore effort, I'm pleased with the
results (e.g., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $43 and it turned out $46).

Have a great weekend.

Ed

Ed,

I shall be available on both days. What about Wednesday,
July 12, between 1:30 and 4:00. Please, let me know
what time would work for you.

It will be nice to see you again.

Vince

P.S. By the way, did you have a chance to take a look at the EOL?
