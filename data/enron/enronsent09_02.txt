Daren,

I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a 
general feel of your end of the process.  Pat had told me before he left that 
it would help me better grasp the process as a whole.

I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not 
be the best time to be in your way.  But let me know if I can spend a day,  
morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good 
time.  I think it will help me very much in my role.

Thanks.

Mike

The new fixed price deal with Equistar is #365013.

We just did a deal for the rest of the month for 10,000/d at meter # 1552 
QE-1 @ $4.355 .... can you let me and Robert Lloyd know what the sitara # is?

Thanks

Melissa,

I'm working hard for you!  Now at 83.5.  I need a new lawnmower, so I'll try 
to bump it up a little more.

Hope you're doing good.

Geoff,

Thanks for the pictures. Looks like the kids had a great time!

I hope you don't mind, but I've taken liberty to turn them into a web photo

to pass this web site address along to other folks, feel free.

If you want a CD copy of this web site, give me a yell.
