it's on tonight

it's did you watch your girl on tv last night?

the deal number is 814014-why can't you see this?

Did you do a deal with National Fuel Marketing purchasing 3,500 mmbtu on May 30th @2.975?  They are invoicing for this and I don't have an invoice for it.  Can you give me the Sitara deal #?

Thanks
Darla

Ok to book for me and my husband, Joseph.  I was issued a new corporate American Express card.  Same number with expiration date of  3/03.  If you need any more info, please advise.   Otherwise, I will assume you will book the two tickets.  Thank you.

should be non bondad

Jane, on deal 763736 for May 01 sales to Southwest Gas, we have a pricing discrepancy.  Our system reflects SJ Bondad GDP but SWG is going to pay us based on SJ Non-Bondad GDP.  Can you please confirm which price is correct and make the change in Sitara if necessary?

Thanks

Sorry about the flooding.  Hope you and your family survived ok.  Attached are the gas settlement and support for May.  The only difference we had was for package V02.  Mark Anderson says that even though Bondad gas flowed, the price was Non-Bondad.

Have a great day.  Nancy

I talked with Markat SW Gas-just honro his numbers

Nancy, can you please reconfirm with Mark the price for the gas at Bondad?  My trader is supporting her price of SJ Bondad GDP rather than SJ Non-Bondad GDP.
