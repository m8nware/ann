Vince, 
Are you going to be able to make the power VAR meeting on Thursday?

Frank

Sheridan,

I have just checked with RAC (David Gorte) and we have a green light

Vince:

I just wanted to check with you regarding the consulting arrangement we
discussed a couple of weeks ago.

Perhaps, we should start with just a 1 or 2 day contract where I give some
thoughts to the kind of issues that we discussed and come to Houston to
present my preliminary thoughts and possible avenues for additional work.

regards,

Sheridan

Bryan,

Did you have a chance to take a look at the resume I sent you?
He looked like a great guy for your group.

Vince

David, 

A reminder. We discussed a few days ago a consulting arrangement with Prof. 
Sheridan Titman from
UT. Any feedback from Rick Buy? Please, let me know.

Per our conversation yesterday...

Hi Kevin,

Further to your call attached is a presentation I gave at the Canadian
Risk Managers Conference in Edmonton in the fall of 2000.   I'll try and
send one of Peter Cox' as well but may have some problems due to file
size.  In any event, my presentation should give you a starting point.

Darrell,

Thanks a lot.
A quick question: we haven't
received your invoice for the last few model / paper reviews.
Please, make sure that we are billed.

Clewlow/Strickland book is out. I shall send you a copy today.

Vince

In case you are interested, I attach

Best, Darrell

Al,

I have spoken with Mark Lay and he is interested.
Even if we cannot help you here in Enron, he may be able
to put you in touch with other CV groups in town.

Please, call him directly and give my name as a reference.
(713) 853-7408

Good luck.

Al,

I have called Mark Lay and left a message on his voice mail.

Vince

Al Arfsten <arfsten@bflassociates.com> on 01/24/2001 11:16:25 AM
Vince:  Your suggestion to introduce the concept discussed with one of
the Lays is welcomed.  I hope that this would mean that you would remain
involved at some level.  The design of the model and its potential
economics could be key to how worthy the effort might be.   Enron could
be an ideal environment from which to the concept enhancement through to
commercialization could be successfully accomplished.  Please
confidentially share matters as you think best and advise me of the
interest generated.  I am ready to meet there at your building or
elsewhere that is appropriate.  Best regards,  Al Arfsten 713 965 2158

Martin,

No problem. Please, ask Stinson as well.

Vince

I thought that since Chonawee has an optimization background, he would be 
good to have him go to dinner with Dr. Lasdon on Thrusday as well.  Would 
this be fine?

Thanks,
Martin
