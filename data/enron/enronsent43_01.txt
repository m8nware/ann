All,

Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar.  I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft.  It is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar.  Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.  You will notice that Questar has requested a "Payment Plan" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events.  If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments, please give me a call.  Also, you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, we have added language in Para 3.2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax.   Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language.  

We hope to execute this Agreement this week.  If you have any comments, please let me know.  After execution, we will forward a final copy to you for your files.

Thanks, 
Kim    713-853-3098

Earl,

We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW (also, I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar's property).  As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW.  Our in-service date is May 1.  If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events, please let me know.  Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of May 1.

Thanks, Kim.

Has a location, Theirs or TW land/ROW, been settled and when is the required in-service date?

Thanks

Are you back in the office yet?

We've booked Italy tickets this week for departing Houston on Friday, May 24 to Newark/Rome and returning on Sunday, June 9 from Rome to Newark/Houston.  Ticket price was $1,183 per ticket. 

Paul and Judy are on board.  Can you and Tom join us?  Janell and Dennis will not be able to go anywhere in 2002 due to Janell's broken leg.

Please call me, let's discuss.

Thanks, Kim  X33098

John, sorry for the late response, but I think you can implement immediately.  I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed (I don't remember if you were there or not) but I'm thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great, thanks!  

Kim.

The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use, I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps. to use for updates. 

How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number?
We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page, we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers. Do you think we need to do more?

Thanks: John Buchanan

Yes, thanks.  I was aware.  I just couldn't remember if it was you or Terry.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,
The new TW Hotline was implemented Monday which included customer notification in the form of a Popup message in TMS and a Critical Notice which sent an Email. The new Hotline phone number is 713-853-3044. I was under the impression that Terry Kowalke had notified you of the implementation, TK was also made aware.

Here it is.  K.
See the attached spreadsheet.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Jan,

These numbers are slightly different from the ones you put together a few weeks ago.  Are you comfortable with the difference?  Any thoughts?  No hurry, I was just wondering.

Thanks, Kim.

Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report.

 

Note:

Total transportation invoiced for 2001 was $180.9m.  The amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $165.9m.

This difference is mainly due to the following:
$10.0m   -   negotiated rates reserve(Reliant,Sempra, Richardson, Astr,and BP Energy) - $collected
$ 2.7m   -    SoCal rate issue - $not collected
$ 1.8m   -    additional month of PGE revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001 - $collected
Revenues for these customers were adjusted according.  

Also, revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW's tariff rates were adjusted accordingly.

Please call me at x36709 if there are questions

thanks,
richard

Kyle,
 
Sorry for not sending this yesterday.  Monday's are always tough.  Please review and let me know what you think.  Let's talk before I leave town next Wednesday.
 
Thanks, Kim.
Kim,
Here is the Job Description and the Operational Accountabilities for the position I mentioned to you last Sunday.  As you can see it will take someone with some very good skills in organizing and interpersonal relationships.  It will also require someone who is fairly mature in their own spiritual journey.  If you know someone who might fit the bill ask them to contact me and/or send me their resume.
See you Sunday.

Mansoor,

Let's discuss.

The in-service date of May 1, will be very difficult to attain. Since the bankruptcy filing, vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid (Daniels, Fisher, Rosemont, other). These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect. Questar may be able to purchase material, but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery. (From time PA approved and funded to in-service will be 75 days at most. We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone. Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered. Not the usual mode of operations. 
The I/C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100% of design). Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP. 
We will try to complete the I/C with the earliest in-service date possible, but with conditions as they are, a realistic date would be June 15, 2002. 
If you have questions or issues, please let me know.

Thanks
