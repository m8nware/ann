Greetings:

IEP will be hosting a dinner for California Governor Gray Davis on Thursday,
December 7, 2000 at the historic Julia Morgan House in Sacramento. We will
be targeting to raise at least $100,000 so company contributions will range
from $10,000-$20,000 per person ($10k minimum per person) depending on the
number of respondents.  We have already received firm commitments from 3
companies.

If you are interested in attending please e-mail me as soon as possible.  A
formal invitation will follow to those who respond.

We need responses or direction by no later than COB on Monday, October 30,
2000.

Please contact me with any questions.

Thank you,

Congratulations.  Everyone is extremely pleased that you're joining.  Best of 
luck and very much looking forward to working together.

Best,

I'll believe it when I see it.  Seems like a good idea to keep the heat on 
Hoecker & Co.right up until Nov. 1.

Thanks.  I'm glad they want to follow-up with Steve (I've been pushing it) 
and I've got some follow-up as well based on chats I had in the afternoon on 
Friday with folks post-call.  Let's regroup on Monday.  I'll be in Portland 
but can call you.

Best,
Jeff

FYI, we had an instructive rest of the conference call on Friday with
Sue and Robbie et al.
They indicated they could use Steve's help face to face at some point.

We are following up with Sue and Robbie on a couple legal issues, case
law and MSA self-certification language, and let me know if you have
additional items.

We await approval on the final tariff language and can then file at the
CPUC.  Let me know what schedule works for you.
Also, can you confirm the correct names, email addresses, titles for
those new folks on Friday's call: Robbie Rossi, Michelle, Melissa Lloyd?

Thanks.

Attached for your review are copies of the settlement documents that were 
filed today in the Gas Industry Restructuring/Natural Gas Strategy 
proceeding, including the Motion for Approval of the Comprehensive Settlement 
that is supported by thirty signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement, the 
Comprehensive Settlement document itself, and the various appendices to the 
settlement.? Because a number of the declarations and signature pages are not 
yet available electronically, they have not been included with this note.? 
Hard copies of the Comprehensive Settlement, including all declarations and 
signature pages, are being shipped tonight via US mail to all parties on the 
service list.? Additional printed copies should be available within the next 
day or so and I will make them available to all of you - just let me know how 
many copies you need.

I would like to thank all of the parties who participated in this settlement 
process.? You have all devoted considerable time, resources and spirit in the 
preparation of this document - and it shows.? We now have a settlement before 
the Commission that includes ratepayer advocates, commercial and industrial 
customers, electric generators, marketers, shippers, independent storage 
providers,? gas suppliers,? producers, utilities, aggregators, pipeline 
companies, wholesale customers, municipalities, and retail mass marketers, 
among others.? 

While we should be proud of our accomplishment, we now must turn to the task 
of getting our testimony ready by May 5 deadline.? Assignments have already 
been made and I will schedule a conference call later this week to discuss 
related details.? So much for resting on our laurels.? Once again, thank you 
all for an outstanding accomplishment.

Attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel I'll be on at a 
CEM conference in SF on Thursday afternoon.  Have distributed to Western GA 
team (plus Steffes) for comment and thought you may have some, too.  

Topic for panel, "PUC Priorities."  Goal is to (politely?) refute Loretta 
Lynch's and Carl Woods' continued assertions that 1) California's move to 
deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2) the 
solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation.  

The FERC order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat.  

Comments are much appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Chris:  

As we discussed yesterday, Laird and I spoke and we think that the 
presentation is good to go for Thursday.  We'll need to update the numbers 
for the offer we made to S.D. last week.  You had mentioned that you might 
want to include a shaped product.  You still considering it?  Let us know and 
we can add it, and make any other changes you'd like to make at this end.

My flight gets into S.D. at at 8:35 on southwest.

Best,
Jeff

Sandi sez it's actually happening at 10 AM and it's renewable-focused.
