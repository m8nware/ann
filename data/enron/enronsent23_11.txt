i have to go to butt-fucking mississippi.  i am not looking foward to that but don't tell val.  the following weekend i will be ready to rock.

i think they are all bark and no bite.  i think they could get their asses kicked by cats.  they look like they were doberman pinchers who were shrunk.  you should get a cockerspaniel.

no, i am not kidding and no i don't want it b/c of the taco bell dog.  i
want it b/c it is really small and cute.  i knew someone in college who had
one and i loved it.  why do you think they are mean?

are you kidding?  why would you want a chihuahua?  those dogs aren't even
friendly.  do you think they are cool b/c of the taco bell dog?
