I need to have a form filled out that says I don't have health insurance 
coverage through Enron.  Can you find out who I need to send it to in HR?

Thanks,

Kay

Your mom just called and said your dad's surgery will be at 2:30 p.m. 
Tuesday, March 20th.  They will be there by noon on the 20th, and the surgery 
will last 1.5 hours and then they'll watch him for 2 more hours before they 
put him into ICU. They are hoping he'll only be in the hospital 48 hours.

Term sheet for draft contract, as requested.

I have a change in plans next week.  My dad is having surgery in Ft. Worth, 
so I will be heading that way on Monday.  I was planning to be on vacation 
anyway, but I may have some accessibility challenges in Ft. Worth which I 
would not have had otherwise.  I will manage client expectations accordingly.

Kay

   I hope you don't change your mind about going to the wedding Sunday.
I plan on taking Michael to the new Star Wars exhibit at the Museum of Fine
Arts.  They showed some kids on TV, and they were quite taken with it.

I'm not planning to get involved since this is your deal.  Is that ok with 
you?

Yes, but this time it is his carotid artery - the one that transports blood 
to the brain.  Big deal kinda stuff.

   
  
  

I hope your dad's surgery goes well!  Is this related to the problems he is 
having getting around (circulatory?)?

For better or worse, all the folks under the heading "Origination"  and 
"Development" are ours, although Kathleen has a special role with Development.

I received a report from HR and it appears there is conflicting information 
regarding some of the titles for various employees.  Please verify that the 
titles are correct for everyone in your group.  The ones that I made changes 
to are in red.

Thanks, Paula.

I formatted the file so that it would print on one legal size sheet.  Please 
use this new file as opposed to the one I sent earlier.

Please review the attached org chart for March and submit any changes by noon 
tomorrow.  It is imperative that all of the information on the attached file 
is accurate, including titles, as this information is being given directly to 
John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen.

Thanks, Paula.

Here's the version showing revisions.
Kay--I finally got it to blackline correctly.  Here it is.  Also attached is 
a sample availability provision (actually 2 different versions).

Good afternoon,

I'm forwarding a revised development agreement term sheet, showing revisions

We look forward to seeing you soon.

I do not think the prior e-mail got through to Kay.

Are either of you familiar with  this project? We have had no contact with 
the ENA/Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I don't want to bust any 
structuring goals.

Our project manager (Scott Laidlaw) and engineer (Harry Okabayashi) want to 
issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to 
support the ENA work. 

I now understand that someone at ENA/Enron Mexico/Enron Wholesale has signed 
an EPC  contract with ABB for this project.

I am not in the office today, so please include Renee Alfaro on your response.
