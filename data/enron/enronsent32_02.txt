I have settled the Ecogas/Enron/Randy Maffett lawsuit.  No need to thank 
me,just send me gifts.  Seriously, I talked this morning with Tom Hall and we 
agreed that Ecogas would pay him $53,000.  Hall has agreed to release Enron, 
Ecogas, Maffett and every affiliate, related party and subsidiary.  He will 
also release any and all patent issues. The goal is for him to move on with 
his life and for us to move on as well.  I have asked Doug Daniels to prepare 
the settlement papers reflecting such an agreement.

Please handle.

Can you pass this along to Elizabeth to ensure Sanders is on board as well?  
We are renewing our L/C's on a month to month basis for the PX per Sanders.  
However, the request below is to "replenish" the CASH that was drawn 
down...please advise.

I agree with Steve's position stated in his separate e'mail.  Don't give 
these guys a penny.----cgy

Tracy,  Do we have concerns here.  We pointed out to the PX that there was 
excess credit.  By using collateral to pay these bills are we not keeping 
required levels available?
