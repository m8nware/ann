I need to check something in 969's 2000 tax return.  Who has the 2000 tax return file for 969?

I think that this is for you since I don't know any of these people.

                          WHO:            Enron

                          WHAT:           Happy Hour for John Suarez

                          WHEN:           Today at 5pm

                          WHERE:  The Front Porch
                                          217 Gray St.
                                          (713) 571-9571

                          WHY:            Today is John's last day at EBS.

This is NOT an Enron-sponsored event.             

How do you feel about taking on another company?

Essie and Leon have proposed xferring Co. 1691 to your world (see below).  Do you concur?  Please let me know Monday morning.

If you have not already made these decisions, Essie's guidance should be helpful.

Essie,

Can you recommend where these companies each fit within the new organization?  If possible, can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5?

Thanks,

Patty

I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group.

18T - EI Indonesia Operations LLC
  This entity is not in TIS, SAP, nor Hyperion.  The 2000 tax return has no income, assets, or liabilities.  There is a corporate data sheet for this company, but this entity seems to have been inactive since it's creation.

86M - Enron Net Works LLC
  Despite the name, this entity appears to be a MTM company.  Per September financials, this company has about $3M of MTM and about $8K of expenses, nothing else.

The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS, and did not get assigned during the reorg.

80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition, Inc.
  This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications (now Enron WarpSpeed Services, Inc. 83N), and then dissolved upon completion of merger.  Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities, but no I/S items.  83N is my responsibility.
  I think this entity should stay with 83N.  So I suggest it be assigned to Leon.  It should be 4 - easy.

1579 - EBS Network Co.
  Division of 17H.  This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group.  Not currently on our list of companies.
  I think this could go to either Holding/Administrative Companies (Same as 17H) or Network & Services (Leon).  4 - easy.

1691 - EPI-EBS Europe
  Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1179.
  A similar entity (1179) was assigned to Commodity and Trade (Todd Richards and Mary Fischer) so this one should be assigned to them as well.  4 - easy.

1307 - EBIC-Apache, LLC
  Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF, a CFC.
  Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax.  4 - easy.

1689 - EPI-EBS Ventures, LLC
  Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1307.
  Same as 1307.  It should be assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  4 - easy.

Let me know if you have any questions.

No problem about moving Company 1691 over

I see that it is a 4, so that will be no problem.
