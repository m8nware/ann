Sara,

Currently we have a blank "sample" for our Paragraph 13s which are attached to our sample ISDAs for (a) US Corporate, (b) Hedge Funds, (c) Municipal.  I will extract the one for the US corporate Paragraph 13 and email to your contact @ First Union Securities.

The sample includes our "caveat", so it should be fine.

Susan:  While Tanya is reviewing credit, can you please send a "blank form Paragraph 13" for this master.  Just our standard.  Caveat:  subject to credit review even though there are blanks.  Thanks.  Sara

Hi Sara,

I just wanted to follow up on whether you will have a chance to send a draft
Credit Support Annex (similar in form to the one previously executed with
ENA).  I understand you may not have credit approval yet so perhaps we can
leave the appropriate sections blank in the meantime.

Thanks and regards,
