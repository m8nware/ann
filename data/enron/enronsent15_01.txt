It was good to hear from you!

We had a nice Thanksgiving here too.  It's funny, because usually it's just 
me, Mom, Craig and Danelia, and Danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or 
roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same 
joy in cooking it would be elsewise.

It was good having the girls down.  We played a new version of Uno called 
"African Uno" that was complex, fast and at times, physically challenging.  
It's not for the meek.  It was incredible what a good player Alena was.  She 
had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses (when you play you'll see 
why you can know everyone elses hands!).

I expect Craig didn't want Mom to see his place because it was messy.  I 
think compared to my house, he's embarrased about his apartment.  Then, also, 
he's got so much stuff in there right now, that I don't know how he's going 
to fit baby stuff.  They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed 
his lease last month because they don't want 3 people in that small 
apartment.  So he's going to have to start looking for another place.  And 
his apartment is so run down down I'm afraid roaches might be crawling over 
the baby.

I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the 
new baby.  You'll have to come visit to check out my new house.  The upstairs 
"guest suite" is pretty neat.  It's got its own bathroom and tv, and is 
pretty cozy.

As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me I 
couldn't tell by his voice.  It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of 
us.  But, I guess, it's a start...

I've already made my XMAS plans.  I leave the evening of the 21st, my flight 
comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.  

It's good chatting with you.  Keep in touch!

Tana,

I don't understand, what do you mean by "log in an email"?

Anyway, I got you message, and I got the World Series thing (although I had
already received

Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving, I can testify that it was
one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I've ever had (I not gonna tell them 
that,
I don't want them getting swell heads).

Ma said she had a great time in Houston, She was happy to see yourself, as 
well
as C & D.  I think she likes her special room in your house.

Your gonna be the first to see the new baby (woudn't it be wierd if the baby
gets botn on Jan 5th?)

Why didn't Craig show Ma his appartment?

What do you think about your phone ocnversation with Unlce Ben (he was almost
shocked)?

Are you coming for Xmas?

Gotta go for now.

Love ya.

Attached is the referenced agreement.  Let me know if the notice information 
is OK with you.  If so, I'll get it signed by Craig Breslau today, then bring 
it to you for countersignature.  Thinking about that, what's your title?  I'm 
not sure you have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority...

No, it does not mean that.   Adding all the Enron "Specified Entities" would 
only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron 
entities a default under this agreement.   Our concern is that we don't want 
any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan 
transaction which has a swap as a component.

If you do add all the entities, does that mean that we would not need to put 
in place a separate agreement for ECCL?
With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB 
would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as 
Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat 
hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured 
loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement.  Sara and Bill 
Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this 
remaining issue.

With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was 
so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was 
sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.  Sara is working on that with Susan 
Bailey, another paralegal in our Group.

Tana - can you please give me an update on where you are in the negotiations 
of the ISDA with the following counterparties and confirm which Enron entity 
you are negotiating on behalf of.

Tks,

I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority, and he agrees that you 
do not have the authority to execute documents on your own, but as long as 
you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a 
control measure we're OK.
