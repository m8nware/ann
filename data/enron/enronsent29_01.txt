Good Morning Debra - I have attached a revised copy of the GISB Agreement
and Special Provisions for your review and consideration.   I anticipate
completing the review of the Master Agreement form and submitting comments
to you by Monday.

In addition, I received feedback from our Gas Desk that the access to the
Gas segment of Enron On-Line was cut off to CPS --- do you know who would
handle this at Enron that we can speak to?  Greatly appreciate your prompt
feedback to this inquiry.

I look forward to your feedback on the GISB.

Regards,
Vangie McGilloway

PS- Were you having  phone system problems this morning?   Myself and Credit
were calling in and none of the calls rolled into voice mail (?).

Further to our conversation,  please see attached  sample agreements.
Upon your review, please give me a call to discuss any questionsand or
issues you may have regarding this matter.

Tammi,

Attached is an image of the GISB.  As you see it was CES acquired by ENA in 
asset purchase.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Best regards,

Priscilla,

I do not find the term "Alternate Transporter Imbalance"  in our agreement..  
The term "Aggregate Transporter Imbalance" is located in several sections.  
Could this be what your referencing?

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

See attached revised Article 4.6 Masters below.

Jill:
 
As discussed,  attached is a GISB draft for Pioneer.  As you can see there 
are several blanks concerning administrative information for ENA Upstream.  I 
was able to secure a Duns# and Fed Tax ID however,  I am lacking Fax and bank 
account numbers. Do you have this information?
