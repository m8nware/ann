Dear Justin

Marly asked me to respond to you.

As you know, the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many
companies. Therefore, any trade mark registration that incorporates the word
ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to
prevent others from using the word ONLINE.

Given the above, if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON (which
covers the services that you offer on-line as well as your core activities),
I'd say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably
unnecessary. However, if you use a particular logo for the on-line service,
that should be registered.

I hope the above is clear.

Jonathan Day

Marly,

If you could respond to me on this request, thanks

Justin

Can one of you give me a quick call to discuss . I'm @ X37047. Thanks.

I believe we are to some extent already protected with "Enron" proceeded
with
anything, but EnronOnline(TM) , etc. just affords us more protection.  I
assume
this is akin to why McDonald's trademarks "Mc"Everything?

Paul,

Can you please give me a call to discuss trademarking?

i.e. Are we covered if we proceed a word with "Enron"?  e.g.: EnronEAuction.

If we are covered, then was it necessary to register EnronOnline?

Thanks,

Dave

Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving the following 
countries to the non-approved list:  Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, and Slovenia.  Below 
is the list, now updated to reflect this change.

Jurisdictions which are are approved to trade credit derivatives:  Finland, 
Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K, and the U.S..

Jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include:  
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, 
Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Singapore, 
Slovenia, Spain, and The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a 
non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a 
branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   
This would have to be determined on a case by case basis.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.

Yes, we should add compliance with OTC Derivatives and/or Commodity Contracts 
and Qualified Party requirements of the Securities Act (Alberta), Securities 
Act (British Columbia) and Securities Act (Ontario).

Thanks, Peter

   

With regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with, 
do we not want to add the Canadian provinces new "eligible swap participant" 
equivalant rules?

You are the best!

Why does it always have to be my deals...?!!!

We've received a personal invitation to a NYMEX  Crawfish Boil on April 3 at 
5:00 at Garden in the Heights at 3926 Feagan.  The cause of this celebration 
is the 10th anniversary of the Nat Gas futures contract.  It would be nice if 
Shankman and John Arnold could attend.  Perhaps you can give them a personal 
invitation...

We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas, 
which adds the Canadian Securities Representation, so we don't have to add 
the rep into every confirm.  BC Gas won't sign the confirms with the rep in, 
and this has caused much difficulties.  I am going to count it as signed, 
since BC Gas has signed, but we still need it to be signed by ECC.  Can you 
get it signed ASAP and back to me.  Much thanks.

We have received the executed  Amendment to the Subscription Agreement with 
WeatherTrade, Inc. dated March 2, 2000.  This Amendment amends the 
Transaction Fee referenced in subparagraph (c) of the Fee Schedule to the 
Subscription Agreement.  Copies will be distributed.

Updating another blue file because Susan B., this time, has not updated it to 
reference mergers & name changes!

It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the 
freeze panel button on, and you probably didn't see them at first.  I didn't 
either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up.  When you have 
a minute, I'll give me a call and I'll come around and show you how to 
unfreeze the panel.

I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the 
confirms for Credit Derivatives, and he said that his current understanding 
is that all of the confirms will be done out of London.  I communicated that 
to Bob Bowen.  He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to 
deal with the Credit Derivatives business.  Wow!

Carol, will you handle this or Mark?

hi mark - i'm a gas trader on the west desk and one of my customers had some 
issues with our electronic trading agreement.  the company is Arco Products, 
adn their comments are on the attached file.  could you take a look at this 
and give me an update.  thanks.
Torrey, as promised I have attached ARCO's suggested revisions to the Enron
online trading agreement. I look forward to working toward a mutually
satisfactory agreement in this new and thorny area of e-commerce contracting.

We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated 
as of December 1, 1999.  This amendment adds the British Columbia Securities 
Act representation to the master.  Copies will be distributed.

Confirmation Desk:  you can stop adding the rep to the confirms now.

Yeah!

Probably...

I just got a call from Dave and Frank and they tell me I have a whole week 
this time to approve the whole counterparty list to trade Australian 
financial power.  I'll need to talk to you about his Monday.

Hey guys, take Monday off!
