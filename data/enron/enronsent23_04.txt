daily dose on enron - 

we are finished.  i need to now get a job at house of pies b/c that is the only way to
 pay the bills.  the economy is down and when enron collapses, the energy industry is going 
to be in a world of hurt.  not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks
.  can't go to anymore lsu games unless i get a free ticket. 

Since work has gone to hell, I am hoping to find some excitement in the possibility that LSU may play in the Cotton Bowl (if Rohan "Alabama" Davey shows up for
the next 3 games.)  However, do not purchase tickets until it is a done deal - a lesson I learned following the Ark game last season.

i have stronger will than you think. house of pies here i come.

i am sure i could have persuaded you to give me some action.  why is enron
blowing up?

i didn't want you to go.  i was just going to sleep anyway.  i was too
tired to give you any action.  enron is blowing up.
