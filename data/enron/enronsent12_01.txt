Jared just told me you have a BUNCH of stuff on your plate and I think you are about to get much busier too. 

cool by me!

Jared, Ruth and I are going to go over all the Florida activity tomorrow morning.  If no one objects, I will be the lead coordinator on Florida starting tomorrow.

Yes maam, she's UBS now.  She was just down here too.

Chris,
I didn't remember if your email mentioned Judy. Did she make it?

OK, I never get to talk to Ruth because SHE IS ALWAYS ON THE PHONE.  And I bet she's on the phone with Shemin too!!!

Should we all get together and make a conference call to Dominion like we did before or should I just call Jeff Davis myself?  Our last call was Iris Kind, Bill Savier(sp?), and Jeff Davis.

Don't forget about me.  I'm still trying to find out what it will take to move gas on and ENA tabs agreement.  No transportation at this point, just a tabs.  Also, it will be much easier for you guys to monitor because most of the deals will be monthly.

Steve, everything looks good with one exception.  The rate schedule on Tennessee should be either NET-2 or NET-284.  I won't find out until Monday.  You review and approve it, keep it on your desk, and I will come over and make the change at your desk on Monday.  Then I'll take it to Ed for his approval.

By the way, Cullen and Dykman is sending copies of what we are doing to Melanie Gray.

Chris: 
Per our conversation a few minutes ago, attached please find the revised Stipulation.  This document has been modified with the changes that were in the mark-up you faxed to Toni Donohue here a few hours ago.  I also deleted "subject to recall" based on our discussion, assuming you get approval for that revision.  You informed me that you would discuss this with your attorney.
Also, as I mentioned to you, we have faxed your mark-up to Melanie Gray at Weil Gotschal in Houston to keep her informed.  (Her voice mail says she's out of the office until Monday.)
Thanks for all your help on this.

A heartwarming story of the advances of women in achieving equality throughout the world.  Barbara Walters did a story on gender roles in Kuwait several years before the Gulf War.  She noted then that women customarily walked about 10 feet behind their husbands.  She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives.  Ms. Walters approached one of the women and said, "This is marvelous.  Can you tell the free world just what enabled women here to achieve this reversal of roles?"

"Land mines," said the Kuwaiti woman.

Cullen and Dykman (attorneys for Boston Gas Company) approved all of our changes on the agreement to release the Tenn and Iroq space back to Boston Gas.  They also made one other change, they are taking out the "subject to recall" language at the bottom of page 2 under item #1.

They will be sending the revised document to me.  I will deliver it to you for your approval.

Maybe we can go drinking too.  That would be fun.  I'll be at your house around 10:30 or 11 tonight.

YOU REALLY DO NOT HAVE TO GO.   I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT GOING ON WITH YOU AND
THE LITTLE WOMAN.    I CAN HANDLE THE TRACTOR.   love TO HAVE YOU ALONG FOR
THE COMPANY, BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARY.   YOU HAVE A LOT ON YOU PLATE, DAD.

Funny.  No.  I didn't feel guilty about the garage sale, that's why I was
annoyed - being notified at 10:00 at night GRRRRRRR.  I do feel guilty
about you doing all this work.  So I'm going with you, I pay for the gas
and the twinkies.
