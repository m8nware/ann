We are still trying to figure out some of the cash traders.  Once we get the word from Lavo we'll let you know. 

Thanks

Kam,

Are there any new developments in the trader world?  We still have the traders and books that you provided last week, but need to know if there are any changes to this.  Please let us know if you need a change so that the deals will bridge with the correct books.

Thanks,
Dawn

Hey,

I am going to have to miss your wedding.  Unfortunately, I will be in Plano that weekend.  I wish I could make it.

What's going on with the UBS weather position?  Has that gone anywhere or are the other possibilities you had better?

Talk to you soon,

Kam

Hey guys,

I am being told by my better half that we need to get an accurate head
count of who will be attending our wedding.  If you would be so kind, could
you possibly let me know of your status over the next couple of days?  For
those of you who already sent us an RSVP response recently, please
disregard.

Thanks for your help!

Jeff

 

WT Cal has been added. Could you run those additional post-id's?  There are deals in the Aruba book so I'm not sure why you aren't picking those up.  The deals are listed below.
Thanks

As seen below,
 
Please start using the ENA DPR 0102 file rather than the EWS DPR 2002 file to send to Chris.  The positions needed to be divided to reflect BCF's.  
 
Thanks
 
Kam
could you also CC me the first few times you send it?
 
 
 
While our established schedules of Tuesday and Friday DPR's would have us reporting tomorrow's activity on Monday, we will change that for month end.  Please email the January 31st DPR information for your respective groups to my attention by noon on Friday.  You should use the same spreadsheet format used for the 1/29/02 DPR.  All p&l and PRMA numbers should be in $'000's.  
 
Starting in February, you will be able to export the data, as opposed to using the spreadsheets.

Kristen,

Attached are all live financial deals by risk type.  As you can see, the price data is too large to fit into one tab.  

After tomorrow, I will no longer have access to the estate files.  Greg Couch will be taking over the responsibility for the estate risk group and will be able to assist you with your requests going forward.  

Thanks

Kam

 

Ed,  

Here is a list of the risk people that will be with the estate.  After this weekend, we will no longer have access to the estate files, these people will be able to help you with any of your questions.  We will still be around to assist them if needed.

Thanks

KK

Here you go...

Sanjeev,

I should have a list of post-id's for you by 4:30 today.  After friday, I will no longer have 
access to the estate, so if you could shoot this off over night so I could have something in the morning to work with I would appreciate it.

Let me know if that doesn't seem possible. 
Thanks

Kam
