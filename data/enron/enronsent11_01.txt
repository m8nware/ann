let me know if you have any interest in the Tco-Pool Leach swap for the winter.  I'll take TCO pool at Index and sale Leach or Pool at Index - $.04.  I can't remember if you guys could do it or not.

Could you tell me what deal tickets you are seeing?

Please check Tenn contract 36647 on the Demand speadsheet.  Sitara isn't matching the spreadsheet.

Thanks,
Brenda

Actually it is not a new truck.  Had 33,000 miles, Ram 2500 3/4 ton, 4 x 4,
360 Magnum Motor.  Infinity stereo, bucket seats, nerf bars, tool box, bed
liner, camper tow package, 5 speed manual.  Oh, it is dueled out through one
catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound.  Makes me want to
race!!!  I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well.  Now,
Debbie wants it.  I gave $16,900 + tax.  It is very clean and is Sandalwood,
Driftwood or something of that nature in color.  Almost silver.  I have to
pick up old gray over at Jerry's.  Debbie said, it is going to be hard on me
to sale my old dodge truck.  I said Yep, had that truck longer than I have
had most of my women.  I really need to engage brain before articulating!  I
am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before
rain.  One thing is for sure, the economy is not faltering on my account.
Dow Stock is back up over $33.  Hooray, hoorah!
Needs to go to $41 and then I will be happy.  I spoke with Gerald and he
said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad's place.  We need to
change the lock and place posted signs at the gate.  I may want to put some
steers or heifers up there.  I am going up soon and having the tractor
fixed.  Reggie said he will pay us soon.  He also still wants the tractor if
we can hold on to it.  First come, first serve.

When is the wedding?  We're set for 11/01/01.  Be sure to take your sweety
out on the balcony tonight and gaze at the full moon.  It was sure beautiful
coming up last night.  We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket
and watch for the space shuttle.  I had a couple of hickies on my neck the
day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns.  Just
jealous.

My kid is making wonderful grades and has reassured me she will graduate
within the four year period.  She still has some sort of scholarship but I
am not for sure how much it pays.  She is going to be a kinesiologist,
sports injury therapist.  I think she just wants to be able to touch
football players legs.  She will be 20 on 11/03.  I am really proud of her.
Cindy said Jaime has grown up very much.
You should e mail her sometimes.  I am sure she would like to hear from you.

At any rate, be careful and be safe.  You should have listened to Maw, as
long as you keep your mouth shut and your pants zipped, you will be alright.
Shucks, guess none of us three paid much attention to that.  Oh, Jeff
Sherrar has a new book out. Rise to Rebellion.
There were some pretty cool dudes back around 1774/76.  There will be two
volumes to this saga.  I am half way through the first and you can borrow it
when I am through.  I sure like his style of writing.  His books are always
hard to put down.

After the split Dow Stock there are 120 shares.

Keep Your Powder Dry!

What's happening?  I understand you have a brand new truck.  Must be
nice having money!!

I need 2 things from you.

  1.      I found the title to the 4 wheeler and I was going to
change it over to you name.  What do you think?  If that's ok, how do
you want your name to show up on          the title and what
address should I use?

  2.      I'm getting ready to divy up the Dow stock.  How many of
Dad's shares do you have?

Last thing, send me a million dollars, I'm tired of working.

I thought we only had cashout, at most 3 times, before this June.  I can't remember.  I do know that most of the time this plant was not buring like it did in July and August of this year.  I say we just keep the dough and go to Mexico.

Hey guys,

Would you please ck the Oglethorpe deal from July 2000  - Dec 2000? Is there supposed to be a cashout booked in Sitara for these months?  Oglethorpe over paid their invoice every month.  I believe that Doug told me the extra was for the cashout that was not invoiced.

Thanks
Darla
