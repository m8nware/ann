# ANN -- a simple annotation tool

## Usage

The normal ANN run sequence may be found in `run.lisp`.
It may be invoked either from the REPL or shell: e.g. `sbcl --load run.lisp`.
If you want to run web app, be sure to add `:dev` into `*features*` like `rlwrap sbcl --eval "(push :dev *features*)" --load run.lisp` or in REPL.

The documents for annotation should be put into the `data/` dir. Currently, a small portion of the Enron corpus is

To select a particular annotation scheme the root folder of the texts to annotate should have a file `.ann.yaml` (similar in format to the [default one](data/.ann.yaml)).

New annotation schemes may be defined in `schemas/` dir. The default one is for NER annotation.

The annotation process is intuitive: just select the spans to annotate and choose the appropriate class. Incorrect annotations may be removed. All changes are persisted to disk in an `.ann` file alongside the text file at once.
